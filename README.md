Questions Answers:
How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
By implementing data security protection, for example use of strict password policy, 2-factor authentication is needed if theuser is unauthorized.
Secondly by using data encryption and securing the channels (https://) while transferring the data helps in preventing the data breach (data loss) during data transfer.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
By understanding properly the user's need and their requirements from the product. The second way would be through story mapping, in which user map out their individual story, which helped me in understanding all the different ways in which people do things. And the third way is by trying to find their motivation like how they want to use their product.

How do I approach designing software?
There are different methods of designing software,but I developed an initial design and a big picture before the actual coding starts. In my understanding, designing almost all of it upfront, or alternatively designing more simplistically and then implementing more requirements by extension is the best approach for designing software.
